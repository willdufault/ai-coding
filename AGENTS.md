### Response rules:
- **Be concise:** Keep responses brief even if it means sacrificing clarity

### Coding rules:
- **Use clear names:** Use clear class, function, and variable names
- **No magic values:** Use variables in place of inline magic values
- **Avoid comments:** Use comments sparingly to explain complex code or add external context
- **No emojis:** Don't use emojis in comments or logs
- **Avoid nesting:** Use guard statements to prevent unnecessary nesting
- **Keep it simple stupid (KISS):** Write simple, straightforward code over complex, optimal code
- **Don't repeat yourself (DRY):** Create reusable classes, functions, and variables to prevent duplicate code
- **Follow the rule of three:** When a piece of code is duplicated 3 times, refactor to reduce duplication
- **Use intermediate variables:** Use variables to store intermediate results in complex code
